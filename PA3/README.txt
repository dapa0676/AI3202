The second heuristic I implemented was the straight-line distance from the node to the start.  Unfortunately, I did not get my program fully debugged.  It does not actually work so I do not have a comparison between this heuristic and the 
manhattan distance heuristic. 

How to Run Program:
My program takes 2 parameters as command line inputs.  The first is the name of the text file to read in, either World1.txt or World2.txt.  The second input is the heuristic you would like to choose; 1 for manhattan distance and 2 for the 
straight line distance.  I picked this heuristic as it was always guarunteed to be lower that the actual cost to the goal.  Again, this program is not fully debugged but in theory, it should function properly.  I encourage you to take a peek through my  code, I know I was not far off the mark.
